# skymap
Sky Map based on D3 and Jason Davies' "Rotate the World" example.

Displays a projection of the night sky (stars only, deep-sky objects and Solar System will come later).
The star database comes from the astronomy nexus (http://astronexus.com/)
The constellation lines and boundaries come from the PP3 program (http://pp3.sourceforge.net/)
